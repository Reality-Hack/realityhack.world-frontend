  # Git Workshop Quick Reference

    ## Initial Setup of the Repo
    1. Fork 
    2. Clone from fork 
    3. Set up remotes

    ## Common Workflow
    1. Fetch upstream 
        - `git fetch upstream`
    2. Checkout upstream/main
        - `git checkout upstream/main`
        - If your working tree is dirty (`git status` shows red/green), do you need the files?
            - Yes: 
                - Stage (GOTO 3, then GOTO 5a) and commit (GOTO 5b) files
            - No:
                - `git reset --hard`
                - GOTO 2
    3. Checkout a new branch 
        - `git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH-NAME`
        - The branch name should be named something based on the work you're doing 
    4. Do work (write code, create art files) 
    5. Save the work 
        - Add files to staging 
            - `git add FILENAME.EXTENSION`
            - Repeat as needed for every file that will be committed 
        - Commit 
            - `git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"`
        - GOTO 4 as needed 
    6. Push to origin new-branch 
        - `git push origin NEW-BRANCH-NAME`
        - GOTO 4 as needed
    7. Open/Modify Pull Request against "upstream/main"
        - GOTO 4 as needed
        - If accepted, merge
    8. GOTO 1
